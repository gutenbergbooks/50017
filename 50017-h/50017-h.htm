<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>Yo-sem-i-te, Large Grizzly Bear</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the world was made, the
Great Spirit tore out the heart
of Kay-o-pha, the Sky Mountains,
and left the gash unhealed. He sent the
Coyote to people the valley with a strong
and hardy race of men, who called their
home Ah-wah-nee, and themselves, the Ah-wah-nee-chees.</p>

<p>The Ah-wah-nee-chees lived the simple,
savage life, which knows no law but to hunt
and kill and eat. By day the trackless forests
rang with the clamor of the chase. By
the flaring light of their fires the hunters gorged
themselves upon the fresh-killed meat, feasting
far into the night. They made war upon the
tribes that lived beyond the walls of Ah-wah-nee
and never knew defeat, for none dared
follow them to their rock-ribbed fastness.
They were feared by all save the outcasts
of other tribes, whose lawless deeds won for
them a place among the Ah-wah-nee-chees.
Thus the children of Ah-wah-nee increased
in number and strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
As time went by, the Ah-wah-nee-chees,
in their pride of power, forgot the Great
Spirit who had given them their stronghold
and made them feared of all their race. And
the Great Spirit, turning upon them in his
wrath, loosed his evil forces in their midst,
scourging them with a black sickness that swept
all before it as a hot wind blights the grain
at harvest time.</p>

<p>The air of the valley was a poison breath,
in which the death shade hovered darkly.
Before the Evil Spirit medicine men were
powerless. Their mystic spells and incantations
were a weird mockery, performed among
the dying and the dead; and when at last
the Evil One passed onward in his cursed
flight, the once proud and powerful band of
Ah-wah-nee-chees was like a straggling pack
of gaunt gray wolves. Their eyes gleamed
dully in their shrunken faces, and the skin
hung in loose folds on their wasted bodies.</p>

<p>Those who were able fled from the valley,
which was now a haunted place, eerie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
with flitting shadows of funeral fires and
ghostly echoes of the funeral wail. They
scattered among the tribes beyond the mountains,
and Ah-wah-nee was deserted.</p>

<p>A vast stillness settled upon the valley,
broken only by the songs of birds and the
roar of Cho-look when Spring sent the mountain
torrents crashing over his head. The
mountain lion and the grizzly roamed at will
among the rocks and tangled chinquapin, fearless
of arrows; the doe led her young by an
open path to the river, where trout flashed
their colors boldly in the sun. In the autumn
the choke-cherries and manzanita berries dried
upon their stems, and ripened acorns rotted
to dust upon the ground after the squirrels
had gathered their winter store. The homeless
Ah-wah-nee-chees circled wide in passing
the valley.</p>

<p>Over beyond To-co-yah, the North Dome,
among the Mo-nos and Pai-u-tes, a few of the
ill-fated Ah-wah-nee-chees had found refuge.
Among them was the chief of the tribe, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
after a time took a Mo-no maiden for his
bride. By this Mo-no woman he had a son,
and they gave him the name of Ten-ie-ya.
Before another round of seasons, the spirit of
the Ah-wah-nee-chee chieftain had wandered
on to the Land of the Sun, the home of happy
souls.</p>

<p>Ten-ie-ya grew up among his mother&rsquo;s
people, but the fire of a warrior chief was
in his blood and he liked not to live where
the word of another was law. The fire in
his blood was kept aflame by the words of
an old man, the patriarch of his father&rsquo;s tribe,
who urged him to return to Ah-wah-nee, the
home of his ancestors, and gather about him
the people whose chief he was by right of
birth.</p>

<p>So Ten-ie-ya went back across the mountains
by a trail abandoned long ago, and from
the camps of other tribes came those in whose
veins was any trace of Ah-wah-nee-chee
blood; and, as before, the number was increased
by lawless braves of weaker bands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
who liked a greater freedom for their lawlessness.
Again, under the favor of the Great
Spirit, the Ah-wah-nee-chees flourished and by
their fierce strength and daring became to
other tribes as the mountain lion to the wolf
and the coyote and the mountain sheep.</p>

alt="A bear looks out from behind some rocks" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;A monster grizzly that had just crept forth from his winter cave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And it chanced that one day while Ten-ie-ya
and his warriors were camped near
Le-ham-i-te, the Ca&ntilde;on of the Arrow-wood, a
young brave went out in the early morning
to the lake of Ke-koo-too-yem, the Sleeping
Water, to spear fish. His lithe, strong limbs
took no heed of the rocky talus in his path,
and he leaped from boulder to boulder, following
the wall that rose sheer above him
and cut the blue sky overhead.</p>

<p>As he reached the base of Scho-ko-ni,
the cliff that arches like the shade of an
Indian cradle basket, he came suddenly upon
a monster grizzly that had just crept forth
from his winter cave. The grizzly knows no
man for his friend; least of all, the man who
surprises him at the first meal after his long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
sleep. The rivals of Ah-wah-nee were face
to face.</p>

<p>The Ah-wah-nee-chee had no weapon
save his fish spear, useless as a reed; yet he
had the fearlessness of youth and the courage
of a race to whom valorous deeds are more
than strings of wampum, piles of pelt or many
cattle. He faced the grizzly boldly as the
clumsy hulk rose to its full height, at bay and
keen for attack. With instinctive love of conflict
roused, the young chief seized a broken
limb that lay at his feet, and gave the grizzly
blow for blow.</p>

<p>The claws of the maddened brute raked
his flesh. The blood ran warm over his
glistening skin and matted the bristled yellow
fur of the grizzly.</p>

<p>The Ah-wah-nee-chee fought bravely.
While there was blood in his body, he could
fight; when the blood was gone, he could die;
but with the traditions of his ancestors firing
his brain, he could not flee.</p>

<p>Furious with pain, blinded by the blows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
from the young chief&rsquo;s club and by the blood
from the young chief&rsquo;s torn flesh, the grizzly
struggled savagely. He, too, was driven by
the law of his breed, the universal law of the
forest, the law of Indian and grizzly alike,&mdash;which
is to kill.</p>

<p>Such a battle could not last. With a low
growl the crippled grizzly brought himself together
and struck with the full force of his
powerful arm. The blow fell short.</p>

<p>Urging his waning strength to one last
effort, the Ah-wah-nee-chee raised his club
high above his head and brought it down
with a heavy, well-aimed stroke that crushed
the grizzly&rsquo;s skull and sent him rolling among
the boulders, dead.</p>

<p>That night as the Ah-wah-nee-chees
feasted themselves on bear meat, the story
of the young chief&rsquo;s bravery was told, and
told again; and from that hour he was known
as Yo-sem-i-te, the Large Grizzly Bear.</p>

<p>In time the name Yo-sem-i-te was given
to all the tribe of Ah-wah-nee-chees, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
for fearlessness and lawlessness were rivaled
only by the grizzly with whom they shared
their mountain fastness. And when long afterward
the white man came and took Ah-wah-nee
for his own, he gave it the name by
which Ten-ie-ya&rsquo;s band was known; and
Cho-look, the high fall that makes the earth
tremble with its mighty roar, he also called
by the name of the Large Grizzly Bear,
Yo-sem-i-te.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>Po-ho-no, Spirit of the Evil Wind</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE white man calls it Bridal Veil.
To the Indian it is Po-ho-no, Spirit
of the Evil Wind.</p>

<p>The white man, in passing, pauses to watch
the filmy cloud that hangs there like a thousand
yards of tulle flung from the crest of the
rocky precipice, wafted outward by the breeze
that blows ever and always across the Bridal
Veil Meadows. By the light of mid-afternoon
the veil seems caught half-way with a clasp
of bridal gems, seven-hued, evanescent; now
glowing with color, now fading to clear white
sun rays before the eye.</p>

<p>The Indian, if chance brings him near this
waterfall, hurries on with face averted, a vague
dread in his heart; for in the meshes of the
Bridal Veil hides an eerie spirit, a mischievous,
evil one&mdash;Po-ho-no. In the ripple of the water
as it falls among the rocks, the Indian hears
Po-ho-no&rsquo;s voice. In the tossing spray he sees
the limp forms and waving arms of hapless
victims lured by the voice to their destruction.</p>

<p>The Indian&rsquo;s mistrust of Po-ho-no dates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
back to a day of long ago, a bright blue day
of early spring such as the children of Ah-wah-nee
love, when the valley has thrown off
its white winter blanket, and dogwood blooms,
and the oaks unfurl their soft green banners
in welcome of the coming summer. It was
the time when deer begin to trail, leaving the
lowlands of the river for the higher ranges;
and while the men hunted in the forest, the
women went forth to gather roots and berries
for the feast.</p>

<p>The Sun had come back from the south;
and as he stood high in the heavens looking
into the valley over the shoulder of Lo-yah,
the Sentinel, three women were tempted to
stray from the others and wander along a
trail that led high above the valley to the
spot whence the misty spray of the waterfall
flutters downward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<a name="veil" id="veil"></a>
<img src="images/yl07.jpg" width="341" height="600"
alt="Po-ho-no hides in the waterfall" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;For in the meshes of the Bridal Veil hides *&nbsp;* Po-ho-no.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>They talked with what zest women may
whose simple lives give them no secrets to
hold or betray. They laughed as they filled
their baskets, stooping to scrape the earth from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
a tender root, to strip the seed from a stalk,
or gather grasses used in basketry; and their
voices were as the purling of lazy waters
gliding over stones. They were happy, for as
yet they knew naught of the joy-sapping fever
of discontent.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the laughter ceased, and in
its stead arose the mocking wail of Po-ho-no,
Spirit of the Evil Wind. The youngest of
the women, venturing near the edge of the
cliff to pick an overhanging wisp of grass, had
stepped upon a rock where moss grew like a
thick-woven blanket. She did not know that
the soft, wet moss was a snare of the Evil
One, and even as the others cried out in
warning, Po-ho-no seized her and hurled her
down among the rocks.</p>

<p>A pair of helpless arms waving in despair;
long, loose hair sweeping across a face, half
veiling one last look of terror&mdash;and she was
gone. If she uttered a cry, the sound was
lost in the gleeful chatter of Po-ho-no and his
impish host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
The two women left above dared not go
near the treacherous ledge, lest they too come
within reach of the vengeful Spirit. Afraid
even to give a backward glance, they hurried
down the steep path to spread the alarm.
Scarce was their story told before a band of
daring braves rushed to the rescue of the
maiden; but though they searched till night
among the rocks where the water swirls and
leaps to catch the rainbow thrown there by
the western sun, they found no trace of her.
The maiden&rsquo;s spirit had joined the forces of
Po-ho-no, and could know no rest, nor be
released from his hateful thrall, until by her
aid another victim was drawn to his doom.
Here she must stay, hidden by the mist from
watchful eyes, beckoning always, tempting always,
luring another soul to pay the forfeit of
her own release. Then, and then only, would
the spirit of the maiden be free to pass on to
the home of the Great Spirit in the West.</p>

<p>Since that day of long ago many of the
children of Ah-wah-nee have fallen prey to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
Po-ho-no, the restless Spirit of the Evil Wind,
who wanders ever through the ca&ntilde;on and puffs
his breath upon the waterfall to make for himself
a hiding-place of mist. Now every Ah-wah-nee-chee
knows this haunt of the Evil
One. By day they hurry past, and not one
would sleep at night within sight or sound of
the fall lest the fatal breath of Po-ho-no sweep
over him and bear him away to a spirit land
of torture and unrest.</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>Hum-moo, the Lost Arrow</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>EE-HEE-NEH was the fairest of the
daughters of Ah-wah-nee, and the
happiest, for she was the chosen
bride of the brave Kos-soo-kah.</p>

<p>When she went forth from her father&rsquo;s
lodge to bathe in the shadowy depths of Ke-koo-too-yem,
the Sleeping Water, her step was
light as the touch of a wind-swept leaf upon
the rocks. When she stooped to lave her
cheeks in the cool spray, her dark hair fell
about her shoulders like a silken web, and
the water mirror showed her a pair of laughing
eyes of the color of ripened acorns, and
in them the soft light of an Indian summer
day. The sound of her voice was as the
patter of rain on green leaves, and her heart
was fearless and full of love.</p>

<p>No other woman of the tribe could weave
such baskets as grew by the magic skill of
her fingers, and she alone knew the secret of
interweaving the bright feathers of the red-headed
woodpecker and the topknots of mountain
quail. Her acorn bread was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
sweetest, the berries she gathered ripest, the
deerskin she tanned softer than any other;
and all because of the love in her heart, for
she knew that Kos-soo-kah would eat of her
bread and fruit, would drink from the baskets
she wove, would wear upon his feet the
moccasins she made.</p>

<p>Kos-soo-kah was a hunter, fearless and
bold, sure with bow and spear, always fortunate
in the chase. In his veins ran the blood
that surges hot when there are daring deeds
to do, and of all the young chiefs of Ah-wah-nee
he had the greatest power among
his people. Like the wooing of the evening
star by the crescent moon was the mating of
Tee-hee-neh with Kos-soo-kah; and when the
young chief gathered together robes of squirrel
and deerskin and of the skins of water-fowl,
arrows and spear-heads, strings of coral and
bear teeth, and gave them as a marriage token
to Tee-hee-neh&rsquo;s father, the old chief looked
upon him with favor.</p>

<p>This was their marriage. But before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
Tee-hee-neh should go with Kos-soo-kah to his
lodge there must be a great feast, and all day
long Ah-wah-nee was astir with signs of
preparation.</p>

<p>From many shady places came a sound like
the tap-tap-tapping of woodpeckers, where the
older women sat upon smooth, flat rocks
pounding dried acorns into meal to make the
acorn bread; and the younger women went
with their baskets to the meadows and woods
for grass seeds, herbs and wild honey.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Kos-soo-kah left his
lodge and gathered about him the strongest
of the young braves to go forth into the forest
and net the grouse, and seek the bear and
deer in their haunts, for this was the man&rsquo;s
share of the marriage feast. While his hunters
strung their bows and fastened arrow-heads
to the feathered shafts, Kos-soo-kah stole away
for a last word with Tee-hee-neh, his bride;
and when they parted it was with the promise
that at the end of the day&rsquo;s hunt Kos-soo-kah
should drop an arrow from the cliff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
between Cho-look, the High Fall, and Le-ham-i-te,
the Ca&ntilde;on of the Arrow-wood. By the number
of feathers it bore, Tee-hee-neh could tell what
the kill had been.</p>

<p>The morning mists were still tangled in
the pines when Kos-soo-kah and his hunters
began to climb the trail that cut into the
heart of the forest. From a covert spot Tee-hee-neh
watched her lover disappear through
the cleft in the northern wall, where the arrow-wood
grows thick; then she joined the other
women and worked with a light heart until
long shadows stretched across the meadow
and warned her of the hour when she was
to be near the foot of Cho-look to receive
the message from Kos-soo-kah.</p>

<p>Far over the mountains Kos-soo-kah
laughed loud with a hunter&rsquo;s pride as he
bound to his swiftest arrow all the feathers of
a grouse&rsquo;s wing. Sped by a hunter&rsquo;s pride
and a lover&rsquo;s pride he leaped along the rocky
trail, far in advance of the youthful braves of
his band who bore among them the best of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
the kill. Eagerly he watched the western sky,
fearful lest the sun&rsquo;s last kiss should tinge the
brow of Tis-sa-ack before he reached the
cliff whence his bow should let fly the message
to the waiting one below.</p>

<p>The frightened quail fluttered in his path
unseen. A belated vulture, skimming the fading
sky, seemed not to be in motion. So swiftly
Kos-soo-kah ran, the wind stood still to let
him pass.</p>

<p>He reached the valley wall at last, his
strength well spent but still enough to pull
his bow to a full half-circle. Poised for an
instant, the feathered shaft caught on its tip a
sun ray, then flew downward; but though
mighty and sure the force that sent it, no
message came to the faithful Tee-hee-neh.</p>

<p>Hour after hour she waited, the joy in
her heart changing to a nameless fear as the
blue sky faded gray, and the gray went purple
in the thickening dusk, and yet no sign, no
sound of the returning hunters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kos-soo-kah! Kos-soo-kah!&rdquo; trembled her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
voice in the stillness. Only a weird echo answered,
&ldquo;Kos-soo-kah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps they had wandered far, and Kos-soo-kah
could not reach the cliff till the night
shadows had crept out of the valley, and over
the tops of the mountains. Perhaps even now
he was returning down the Ca&ntilde;on of the
Arrow-wood. This she whispered to a heart
that gave no answering hope.</p>

<p>She would go forward to meet him, and
hear from his lips the message which the
arrow failed to bring. As she hurried along
the narrow trail, clinging to the slanting ledges,
pushing aside the overhanging branches, she
called and called, &ldquo;Kos-soo-kah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now and again she stopped to listen for
the sound of voices, or of footsteps, but only
the cry of a night bird or the crackling of
dry twigs stirred the still air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">

<img src="images/yl09.jpg" width="381" height="600"
alt="Tee-hee-neh sits on a rock, looking over the edge" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Crouching there *&nbsp;* she called again, &lsquo;Kos-soo-kah!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Trembling with uncertainty and fear, she
reached the top of the sharp ascent. There
by the light of the stars she saw fresh footprints
in the loose, moist earth. Her heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
told her they were his; her quick eye told her
they went toward the cliff, but did not return.
Crouching there beside them, she called again,
&ldquo;Kos-soo-kah!&rdquo; Not even an echo answered
the despairing cry.</p>

<p>Slowly she crept forward, following the
fresh trail to the edge of the wall. She leaned
far over, and there on a mound of fallen rock
lay her lover, motionless, nor answering her
call. Tight in his grasp was the spent bow,
the sign of a promise kept.</p>

<p>As she looked, there came again to Tee-hee-neh&rsquo;s
mind the dull roar of rending rock,
the low moan of falling earth, that ran through
the valley at the sunset hour. Now she knew
that as Kos-soo-kah drew his bow to speed
the messenger of love, the ground beneath his
feet had given way, carrying him with the
fatal avalanche.</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s heart no longer beat fast with
fear. It seemed not to beat at all. But there
was no time for grief,&mdash;perhaps Kos-soo-kah
had not ceased to breathe. On the topmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
point of rock she lighted a signal fire, and
forced its flames high into the dark, flashing a
call for help. It would be long, she knew,
before any one could come; but this was the
only chance to save Kos-soo-kah.</p>

<p>Hours passed. With feverish energy she
piled dry branches high upon the signal fire,
nor let its wild beckonings rest a moment. At
last old men came from the valley, and the
young braves from the mountains bearing with
them the carcasses of deer and bear.</p>

<p>With their hunting-knives they cut lengths
of tamarack, and lashed them together with
thongs of hide from the deer killed for the
marriage feast. By means of this pole they
would have lowered over the edge of the cliff
a strong young brave but that Tee-hee-neh
pushed him aside and took his place. Hers
must be the voice to whisper in Kos-soo-kah&rsquo;s
ear the first word of hope; hers the hand to
push aside the rocks that pinioned his body;
hers the face his slowly opening eyes should see.</p>

<p>They lowered her to his side; and, loosing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
the cords that bound her, she knelt beside
him, whispering in his ear, &ldquo;Kos-soo-kah!&rdquo; No
sound came from the cold, set lips. The wide-open
eyes stared unseeing at the sky. Tee-hee-neh
knew that he was dead.</p>

<p>She did not cry aloud after the manner
of Indian women in their grief, but gently
bound the helpless form with the deerskin
cords and raised it as high as her arms could
reach when the pole was drawn upward;
then waited in silence until she was lifted by
the willing hands above.</p>

<p>When she found herself again at Kos-soo-kah&rsquo;s
side, she stood for an instant with eyes
fixed upon the loved form, there in the cold,
starless dawn of her marriage day; then with
his name upon her lips she fell forward upon
his breast. They drew her away, but the
spirit of Tee-hee-neh had followed the spirit
of Kos-soo-kah.</p>

<p>The two were placed together upon the
funeral pyre, and with them was burned all
that had been theirs. In Kos-soo-kah&rsquo;s hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
was the bow, but the arrow could not be
found. The lovers had spirited it away. In
its stead they left a pointed rock lodged in the
cliff between Cho-look, the High Fall, and
Le-ham-i-te, the Ca&ntilde;on of the Arrow-wood, in
token of Kos-soo-kah&rsquo;s fulfilled pledge. This
rock is known to the children of Ah-wah-nee
as Hum-moo, the Lost Arrow.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>Py-we-ack, the White Water</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE the peaks of Sky Mountains were
little hills, the Ah-wah-nee-chees have
lived in the deep, grassy valley the
white man knows as Yo-sem-i-te. Eastward
of To-co-yah, the Acorn Basket Rock, live
the Mo-nos; and for a thousand years the
sachems of the Ah-wah-nee-chees and the
sachems of the Mo-nos smoked the pipe of
peace together.</p>

<p>In the autumn when the Great Spirit
swept through Ah-wah-nee with a breath of
frost, painting the leaves all scarlet and gold
and brown, scattering tufts of snow-white
cloud across the blue sky, and weaving a web
of bluish haze among the green pine tops, the
Ah-wah-nee-chee braves prepared for the last
great hunt of the year. The feast of the
manzanita berries was past, and the feast of
acorns, and after the autumn hunt came the
feast of venison.</p>

<p>As the time of the feast drew near, runners
were sent across the mountains, carrying
a bundle of willow sticks, or a sinew cord or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
leaf of dried grass tied with knots, that the
Mo-nos might know how many suns must
cross the sky before they should go to Ah-wah-nee
to share the feast of venison with
their neighbors.</p>

<p>And the Mo-nos gathered together baskets
of pi&ntilde;on nuts, and obsidian arrow-heads,
and strings of shells, to carry with them to
give in return for acorns and chinquapin nuts
and basket willow, which do not grow on the
farther side of Sky Mountains and which the
Great Spirit has given in plenty to the children
of Ah-wah-nee.</p>

<p>At the feast the great chiefs sat side by
side and the smoke of their pipes curled into
a single spiral in the air. And when all were
gorged with food, they danced about the fire
chanting the mighty deeds of their ancestors,
or sat upon the ground playing the ancient
hand game, he-no-wah, staking their arrows
and their bearskin robes, their wampum and
their women upon the hand that held the
hidden willow stick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
Not only in their pastimes were they
friends. When the Great Spirit wafted a
soul to the happy land in the West, the runners
went again across the Sky Mountains
and the tribes gathered together to join in the
funeral dance and mingle their voices in the
funeral wail. In grief, as in joy, they were
friends,&mdash;for a thousand years.</p>

<p>But the law of the mountain and the
forest is not a law of peace, and it was the
will of the Great Spirit that they should not
dwell always in harmony.</p>

<p>The Ah-wah-nee-chees numbered more
men than women; and from time to time
bands of young braves, in the flush of primal
strength, swept through the country with the
ungoverned madness of a bullock herd, carrying
away women from the villages they raided.</p>

<p>When the Mo-no men came to Ah-wah-nee
to the feasts of the manzanita berry and
of acorns and of venison, they brought their
women with them. These mountain women
were pleasing to the eye, erect as the silver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
fir that grows upon the mountain side, clean-limbed
and free of motion as the panther;
and more than all others were they coveted
by the Ah-wah-nee-chees, who chafed under
a friendship that thwarted desire.</p>

<p>And the story is told that at a certain
feast of venison Wa-hu-lah, a Mo-no maiden,
stirred the fancy of a young warrior of
Ten-ie-ya&rsquo;s band. Spring, the love season of
Nature&rsquo;s children, had passed the young warrior
many times since he came to manhood,
and he had not heeded her soft whisper. But
never before had he seen Wa-hu-lah, the
Mo-no maiden.</p>

<p>Now, through all the time of feasting, he
watched eagerly for the love sign in Wa-hu-lah&rsquo;s
eyes; but he saw there only the depth
and the darkness and the mystery of a pool
hidden in the heart of a forest of pines, which
no ray of sunlight pierces.</p>

<p>Love was dead in the heart of Wa-hu-lah.
On her face could still be seen dim
traces of mourning, lines of pitch and ashes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
not yet worn away, though there had been
two seasons of grass and flowers since her
voice rose in the funeral wail beside the pyre
of her dead lover. She had not died as the
dove does when her mate is gone; but she
could not forget, and as she sat among the
feasters sorrow throbbed in her heart like the
ceaseless whirr of a grouse&rsquo;s wing. The Ah-wah-nee-chee
warrior sought in vain for an
answering sign, and when the days of feasting
were over Wa-hu-lah went away with her
father.</p>

<p>Day and night the Ah-wah-nee-chee thought
of his love; the face of Wa-hu-lah was ever
before his eyes; and he knew that he must
follow her and bring her to his lodge. But
already the snow-clouds resting on the peaks
of Sky Mountains were scattering their burden,
soft and white as the down of Tis-sa-ack&rsquo;s
wings. Valley and forest lay lifeless
under a thick blanket, and the trails were
choked with snow.</p>

<p>The Ah-wah-nee-chee&rsquo;s love smouldered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
through the winter months, with naught but
the memory of Wa-hu-lah&rsquo;s sad, unanswering
eyes to feed upon. Far away, in the wig-wam
of her father, Wa-hu-lah nursed her
grief.</p>

<p>At last spring came, with soft, straying
winds that breathe of new life. Birds sang
in the trees as they built their nests; squirrels
chattered softly among the rocks; Too-loo-lo-we-ack,
the Rushing Water, babbled of the
joys of summer; and Yo-wi-we dashed from
the heights to carry the message of love
brought by the sun from the southland to all
the valley.</p>

<p>While yet the trails were heavy with
melting snows, the Ah-wah-nee-chee warrior
stole away from his lodge one night and set
his face toward the rising sun, yonder to the
eastward of To-co-yah; and ere the day god
had wrapped himself in his flaming cloud
blanket in the far-off West, the Ah-wah-nee-chee
was smoking the peace pipe with the
chief of the Mo-nos, Wa-hu-lah&rsquo;s father.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The white spirits of the water threw themselves around the maiden
and hid her in a shroud of spray.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
Before the sun again strode the bald
peaks of the Sky Mountains, he was gone;
and when the women came forth to make
ready the morning meal, the old chief saw
that Wa-hu-lah was not among them; and he
knew that the spirit of the peace pipe had
been violated.</p>

<p>Wa-hu-lah made no struggle when she
found herself borne along in the arms of her
captor. Her heart beat like the heart of a
hunted thing that feels the hunter near and
cover far away, but her face showed no sign.
It was useless to resist; but had the Ah-wah-nee-chee
looked into the still, sad depths of
her eyes, he would have seen there a glittering
spark, the fire of a woman&rsquo;s lasting hate.</p>

<p>Along the heavy trail he toiled, and not
until he reached the kinder paths that Spring
had cleared did he let Wa-hu-lah&rsquo;s feet rest
upon the ground. Then she walked before
him, silent, submissive, but with the spark still
glowing in her downcast eyes.</p>

<p>Silent, submissive, she followed as he led
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
the way to the place he had prepared for
her,&mdash;a woodland bower, pine carpeted, roofed
with boughs of oak and alder, the couch of
branches spread with deerskin.</p>

<p>Silent, submissive, she ate of the food he
brought her, fresh bear meat and acorn bread,
and grass roots fattened by the melting snows.</p>

<p>Silent still, but with submission changed to
defiant purpose, she watched him go away
and take his place among the braves of his
tribe who ate as the women prepared their
food. Hunger possessed him and he gave no
thought to caution. At another time his quick
ear might have caught the sound of twigs
snapping under the pressure of a moccasined
foot; now it heard only the hiss of meat
thrown upon live coals.</p>

<p>The moon floated high above Cloud&rsquo;s
Rest and the valley was full of light, yet
none saw the dark figure that crept stealthily,
warily, into the shadow of the crouching
chaparral, keeping with the wind that blew
from, not toward, the camp-fire. Once only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
Wa-hu-lah paused, and turned to see that she
was not discovered; and from her eyes shot
one swift look that would have killed, could
looks deal death. Then she sped forward on
the trail that led from Ah-wah-nee, with its
blossoming dogwood and azalea, its buckthorn
and willow, to the snows of the higher mountains,
the home of her people.</p>

<p>Swiftly she ran, frightened by the night
shapes that danced before her in the path,
nor daring to slacken her pace or give a
backward glance. But scarce had she passed
through the spray thrown across the trail by
Py-we-ack, the White Water, when she heard
wild shouts rising from the half-darkness
below, shouts that told her the Ah-wah-nee-chees
knew that she was gone, had started in
pursuit. Behind her on the trail her footprints
lay naked on the yielding earth, and she knew
that here in Ah-wah-nee the men of Ten-ie-ya&rsquo;s
band knew every path that she might choose,
every tree and rock where she might find a
hiding-place. Already the race was won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
Nearer they came, her Ah-wah-nee-chee
captor and a score of braves who joined
with boisterous shouts this chase that had no
need of cunning since for a weak prey there
was no escape.</p>

<p>Among the trees they caught uncertain
glimpses of the fleeing figure, but at last
Wa-hu-lah bounded into a clear, broad stretch
of moonlight where the trees fall back to let
the river widen to a calmer course after its
reckless plunge from the cliff above.</p>

<p>The pool that shines emerald bright by day
lay still and black with the pale gold moon
upon its breast. Straight for its bank Wa-hu-lah
ran, and as her foot touched the rocky
ledge, her pursuers sprang with a cry of
triumph into the open. Not a moment did
the maiden dare to lose. Stooping, she
unloosed the canoe that floated in the shadow
of the ledge, a canoe used by the Ah-wah-nee-chees
in crossing the Emerald Pool.</p>

<p>Stepping into the shallow bark, Wa-hu-lah
pushed it from the shore, and with quick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
strokes drove it toward the middle of the
stream, where she knew the water ran swift
and deep and strong.</p>

<p>Like some strange night bird the canoe
skimmed the surface of the pool, the girl
erect, defiant, her long black hair tossing,
winglike, on the wind. Drawn by the current
it glided on, dark and silent, toward
Py-we-ack, where the water with a second
leap dashes itself to death upon the rocks.</p>

<p>Along the shelving bank the baffled Ah-wah-nee-chee
ran, but swifter ran the dark
and silent figure in the stream; and even as
the young chief plunged into the icy water in
one last effort to reclaim his stolen bride, the
boat slipped over the edge of the cliff and
went to pieces on the rocks, where the white
spirits of the water threw themselves around
the maiden and hid her in a shroud of spray.</p>

<p>Thus Wa-hu-lah proved herself faithful to
her Mo-no lover, and the Ah-wah-nee-chee
was cheated of his bride.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah and Tis-sa-ack</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>INCE the world was young Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah,
the Rock Chief, had guarded
Ah-wah-nee, the home of the children
of the sun. For his watch-tower he chose a
storm-tried rock on the northern wall of the
valley, and from this far height defied all
the powers of evil.</p>

<p>In the spring he besought the Great
Spirit to send rain that the wild corn might
hang heavy with tasseling grain, the berries
cluster thick on the branches of the manzanita,
and the fish abound in the waters of
the river. In the summer he fattened the
bear and deer, and in the autumn he wandered
through the mountains driving them
from their haunts that the hunter might not
return empty-handed from the chase. The
smoke of his pipe spread like a soft haze
through the air, sheltering the women from
the sun when they went forth to gather acorns
and wood for winter.</p>

<p>His form was like a spear, straight and
strong; and he reared his head high above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
the clouds. In his arm was the strength of
an untamed grizzly; and his voice was like
the sound of Cho-look, the great fall that
thunders down from the north, starting deep
echoes from crag and gorge. When the sunlight
danced upon the water, the Ah-wah-nee-chees
were happy, for they knew that
Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah smiled; when the sky was
overcast, they trembled, fearful of his frown;
when his sighs swept mournfully through the
pines, they, too, were sad. The children of
Ah-wah-nee loved the mighty Rock Chief who
dwelt above them in his lonely lodge.</p>

<p>One morning, as his midnight watch drew
to a close and the first pale glint of day
shone on his forehead, he heard a soft voice
whisper, &ldquo;Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes burned with the passion fire as
a fair vision rose before him, yonder on the
granite dome of the southern wall. It was
the form of a maiden, not of the dark tribe
he loved and guarded, but fairer than any he
had seen or known in dreams. Her face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
had the rosy flush of dawn, her eyes took
their color from the morning sky, and her
hair was like strands of golden sunlight. Her
voice was low as a dove call when she
whispered Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>For a moment she lingered, smiling; but
even as the Rock Chief leaped from his
tower in answer to her call, she glided
across the rounded dome and faded from his
sight, leaving her throne shrouded in a snowy
cloud. Piqued by the mystery of her flight,
Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah followed the sound of her
rustling garments, wandering all day over the
mountains; but the pine trees wove a blue
mist about her, hiding her from his eyes. Not
until he returned to his citadel at night did
he see her face again. Then for an instant
she appeared upon her throne, her pale brow
tinged with the rose glow of the sun; and
he knew that she was Tis-sa-ack, the Goddess
of the Valley, who shared with him the loving
care of the Ah-wah-nee-chees.</p>

<p>Every morning now at dawn Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
left his tower and sped across the
valley to meet the lovely goddess of his
heart&rsquo;s desire. Through the day he hovered
near her, gazing upon the fair form, always
half hidden by billowing cloud, trying to read
an answering love in her wide blue eyes.
But never again did he hear the voice that
came to him across the valley in the stillness
of that one gray dawn.</p>

<p>Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah&rsquo;s passion grew day by
day, as summer ripens the fruits of springtime
budding; but Tis-sa-ack had no joy in
his love. Her heart was heavy with a great
sorrow, for she saw that the Rock Chief was
blind to the needs of his people, that he had
forsaken those who looked to him for life.</p>

<p>The sun burned his way through the sky,
and no rains fell to cool the aching earth.
Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah paid no heed to the withering
leaves of the wild corn, the shrunken
streams from which the fisherman turned
with empty nets, the shriveling acorns that
fell worthless to the ground. He neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
knew nor cared that the hunter, after weary
days in the mountains, came to his lodge at
night with arrows unused, to meet the anxious
glance of starving women and hear the wailing
cry of hungry children.</p>

<p>The Ah-wah-nee-chees called upon the
Rock Chief in vain. He did not hear their
cries; he thought only of his love. The harvest
moon looked down into the valley and saw
the dark form of Famine skulking there.
Then it was that Tis-sa-ack&rsquo;s love was swept
away by an overwhelming pity; and as she
lay upon her couch she cried out to the
Great Spirit to send the rain-clouds that
bear life to all things of the earth.</p>

<p>And even as she prayed, there came
an answer to her prayer. With a voice
of thunder the Great Spirit gave commands
to the spirits of the air. With a barbed
shaft of lightning he rent the granite dome
where Tis-sa-ack prayed; and from the
cleft rock came a rush of water that filled
the dry basin of Wai-ack, the Mirror Lake,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
and sent a wandering stream through the
thirsty fields.</p>

<p>Now the withered corn-stalks raised their
drooping heads, flowers nodded among the
waving grasses and offered their lips to the
wild bees, and the acorns swelled with sap
that crept upward from reviving roots. The
women went joyously into the fields to gather
the harvest, and the men no longer returned
with empty pouches from the forest or fished
by the riverside in vain.</p>

<p>The chief of the Ah-wah-nee-chees ordered
a great feast, and all faces were turned in gratitude
to the dome where Tis-sa-ack dwelt. But
Tis-sa-ack was gone. She had sacrificed her
love, her life, for the children of Ah-wah-nee.
Through her they had suffered; through her
their sufferings had ceased; and that all might
hold her memory dear she left them the lake, the
river and a fragment of her throne. Upon the
bosom of Ke-koo-too-yem, the Sleeping Water,
her spirit rests, wandering sometimes of a summer
evening to the Half Dome, there to linger for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
moment as the sun slips over the western
wall of the valley.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Her spirit, *&nbsp;* wandering *&nbsp;* to the Half Dome, there to linger
for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>As she flew away a soft down from her
wings fell upon the earth; and where it fell,
along the edge of the river and over the
meadows stretching toward Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah&rsquo;s
watch-tower, one can now find tiny white
violets, whose fragrance is the secret of a loving
spirit, a breath of happiness to all who gather
them.</p>

<p>When Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah found that Tis-sa-ack
was gone, a great sadness came upon him.
Day and night his sighs swept through the
pine trees. He puffed gloomily at his pipe until
his tower was hidden in a cloud of smoke.
At last, thinking to follow and find his lost
love, he went away; and lest he be forgotten,
he carved with his hunting-knife the outlines
of his face upon the wall of his fortress, which
the white man has named El Capitan.</p>

<p>As he turned sadly from his lodge, Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah
perceived that the air was filled
with a rare and subtle perfume, blowing from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
a stretch of meadow fringed with tamarack.
Thinking it the breath of Tis-sa-ack, he followed
on and on, forgetful of the arts of E-ee-ke-no,
who dwells among the water-lilies in
the lake which the Three Brothers hold in
the hollow of their hands.</p>

<p>E-ee-ke-no had long loved the Rock Chief,
but Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah scorned her unsought
love, which turned through jealousy to bitter
hate. Now as she saw him go away in search
of Tis-sa-ack, she threw around him the mystic
fragrance of the water-lily, which, gentle as a
caress, is deadly to all who win the hatred of
E-ee-ke-no.</p>

<p>On and on across the meadow fringed
with tamarack, among the wild flowers and the
waving grasses, Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah wandered,
following blindly the transformed spirit of E-ee-ke-no
until he disappeared forever in the
depths of the lake.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>Kom-po-pai-ses, Leaping Frog Rocks</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OREVER and forever the Three
Brothers sit looking over each other&rsquo;s
shoulders from the north wall of
Ah-wah-nee.</p>

<p>The Indians likened these peaks to frogs
sitting back upon their haunches ready to leap,
and called them Kom-po-pai-ses, the Leaping
Frog Rocks. This the white man did not
know when he named them the Three Brothers.</p>

<p>The story of the Three Brothers is history,
not tradition. It has to do with the
coming of the white man to Ah-wah-nee, and
the downfall of Ten-ie-ya, the last chief of
the Ah-wah-nee-chees.</p>

<p>Across the plains that billow away toward
the sea, Ten-ie-ya watched the approach of
the white stranger, having always in mind the
words of the old man who was his counselor
when he left the land of his Mo-no mother
and returned to Ah-wah-nee to rule over his
father&rsquo;s people.</p>

<p>The patriarch had heard the call of the
Great Spirit, bidding him to the happy land
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
of the West, and had told Ten-ie-ya many
things. This, last of all:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obey my word, O Ten-ie-ya, and your
people shall be many as the blades of grass,
and none shall dare to bring war into
Ah-wah-nee. But look you ever, my son,
against the white horsemen of the great plains
beyond; for once they have crossed the western
mountains, your tribe will scatter as the
dust before a desert wind, and never come
together again. Guard well your stronghold,
O Ten-ie-ya, lest you be the last of the
great chiefs of Ah-wah-nee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The faded eyes had the light that comes
when the call of the Great Spirit sounds very
near, and the feeble hand of the patriarch
trembled as he raised his pipe above his
head, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Spirit, I pray be good to my son,
the chief of the Ah-wah-nee-chees. Toward
the pines, north, cold wind treat him kindly;
toward the rising sun, east, great sun shine
upon his lodge in the early morning; toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
the place where the sun goes in winter, south,
bless my son; toward the land of the setting
sun, west, waft on the breezes a peaceful
sleep. And, lowering my pipe, I say, kind
mother earth, when you receive my son into
your warm bosom, hold him gently. Let the
howl of the coyote, the roaring of the bear
and the mountain-lion, and the sound of
winds swaying the tops of the pine trees, be
to him a sweet lullaby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because of these last words of the dying
seer, Ten-ie-ya guarded his mountain retreat
as a she-bear guards the refuge of her young.
With vague foreboding he saw the white
horsemen coming nearer. They took the land
that the Great Spirit had made for the people
of his race. They burrowed into it like
moles, and washed the sands of its rivers,
searching for something yellow and shining
that the Indian neither knew was there nor
cared to know. They grazed their horses
and their cattle upon the broad stretches that
had been the Indian&rsquo;s hunting-ground since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
time began. They even went so far, these
pale-faced strangers, as to steal Indian women
for their wives. And always they made their
camps nearer and nearer to Ah-wah-nee.</p>

<p>While the vigor of youth remained, Ten-ie-ya
did not fear these men of an alien
race. He only hated them. With his band
of lawless Grizzlies he stole forth in the night
and drove away their horses to kill for food;
and as they feasted, drunk with the taste of
warm blood, their spirits were made bold, and
the deep gorge rang with shouts of defiance.</p>

<p>But Ten-ie-ya grew old, and the white
horsemen of the plains, now strong in number,
were at the very walls of Ah-wah-nee.
The words of the dying patriarch were ever
in his ears, and he knew that the evil day
was come.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<a name="prayer" id="prayer"></a>
<img src="images/yl15.jpg" width="345" height="600"
alt="The seer holds up his pipe and speaks to the Great Spirit" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Toward the pines, north, cold wind treat him kindly.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>At last the white men climbed the western
mountains, offering gifts in the name of the
Great Father, their chief; and when they
went away they led Ten-ie-ya captive to their
camp. The young braves fled from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
Ah-wah-nee, across To-co-yah, the North Dome,
to the home of the Mo-nos. It was well
that Ten-ie-ya should go to the plains, they
said; but they were young and could find
plenty in the mountains; they would not go
to be herded like horses in the white man&rsquo;s
camp.</p>

<p>Though he appeared to yield, the spirit
of Ten-ie-ya was not broken. Like a wild
beast in captivity, he chafed under restraint.
With the cunning of his race, he watched his
chance; and when it came, he returned to his
stronghold in the Sky Mountains, bearing in
his heart a fiercer hate for the white man, a
hate made keener by defeat, a hate that
burned for revenge.</p>

<p>But an evil spell seemed cast upon the
children of Ah-wah-nee. They were scattered,
and they did not rally round their
chief. Again the white horsemen climbed
the western mountains, this time without
gifts. But day and night signal fires had
burned upon the mountain tops; and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
the messengers of the Great Father entered
Ah-wah-nee they found the valley deserted,
save for five dark figures that darted like
shadows from tree to rock at the base of a
jagged spur of the northern wall.</p>

<p>Feeling themselves secure because of the
swollen river that lay between, the five scouts
came into the open when discovered, and
mocked the strangers; then disappeared up the
side of a cliff so straight and pathless that no
white man could follow. By fair promises
carried to them by an Indian guide they
were induced to come into camp, and three
of them were found to be sons of Ten-ie-ya.</p>

<p>It does not speak for the faith of white
men that one of the brothers was killed while
held as hostage until the aged chief should
come in and deliver himself to the messengers
of the Great Father; and that only an uncertain
aim saved another who tried to escape
through the Ca&ntilde;on of the Arrow-wood,
where his father was hiding. When he saw
it was useless to resist further these fearless,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
faithless horsemen of the plains, who had
stolen his lands and his women, who would
not let him live in peace in his mountains,
Ten-ie-ya came down from Le-ham-i-te, the
Ca&ntilde;on of the Arrow-wood, by a trail that
led into the valley through the branches of
a giant oak.</p>

<p>The first sight that met the gaze of the
twice-conquered chieftain was the dead body
of his youngest son. He spoke no word, but
lines of sorrow appeared in the hard, old
face; and secretly, in the heart of the night,
he had the young chief&rsquo;s body carried away&mdash;none
knew where. Once more he tried
for his liberty; once more was captured.
Then in a passion of grief and rage, he
turned his bare breast to his captors, and
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill me, white chief, as you have killed
my son, as you would kill all my people if
they would but come to you. You have
brought sorrow to my heart. For me the
sun shines no more. Kill me, white chief, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
when I am dead I will call my people, that
they shall come and avenge the death of their
chief and his son. My spirit will follow your
footsteps forever. I will not leave the spirit
world, you will not see me, but I will follow
you where you go and you will know it is
the spirit of the old chief, and you will fear
me and grow cold. This is the message of
the Great Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ten-ie-ya&rsquo;s hour was not yet come.
He was to die, for an act of treachery, at
the hands of the Mo-nos, his mother&rsquo;s people.
Even so, the prophecy of the seer was fulfilled,
for the white horsemen of the plains
had crossed the western mountains, the tribe
was scattered, never to come together again,
and Ten-ie-ya was the last great chief of the
Ah-wah-nee-chees.</p>

<p>Because his three sons were captured at
its base, the triple peak in the northern wall
was given the name Three Brothers.</p>
